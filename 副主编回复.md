This paper proposes a novel method for Hyperspectral Image Denoising via Dynamically Adjusted Regional Rank. Three Reviewers gave some positive comments. However, there are still some comments that should be addressed. First, deeper explanation on theory such as dynamic rank calculation and convergence should be highlighted. Second, SOTA methods, complexity and different experimental strategies should be compared. Third, grammar errors should be corrected.
首先，应着重强调诸如动态排名计算和收敛等理论的更深入解释。其次，应将最先进的方法、复杂度以及不同的实验策略进行比较。第三，应纠正语法错误。
